  // Your drawing code goes here
})
```

## Installing

To install the canvas package under your local typst package dir you can use the `install` script from the repository.

```bash

```

The installed version can be imported by prefixing the package name with `@local`.

### Just

This project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just), a handy command runner.

You can run all commands without having `just` installed, just have a look into the `justfile`.
To install `just` on your system, use your systems package manager. On Windows, [Cargo](cargo install just) (`cargo install just`), [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (`choco install just`) and [some other sources](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_4.html) can be used. You need to run it from a `sh` compatible shell on Windows (e.g git-bash).

## Testing

This package comes with some unit tests under the `tests` directory.
To run all tests you can run the `just test` target.

You need to have ImageMagick installed on your system, which is needed for image comparison.

### Windows
If you are using the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager, you can install imagemagick using `choco install imagemagick`.
Otherwise download and install a matching package from the [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) website.
