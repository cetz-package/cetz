/// Each level of `dict` is then processed with these steps. If `root` is given the level with that key will be the first, otherwise the whole of `dict` is processed.
/// + Values on the corresponding level of `merge` are inserted into the level if the key does not exist on the level or if they are not both dictionaries. If they are both dictionaries their values will be inserted in the same stage at a lower level.
/// + If an entry is `auto` or a dictionary, the tree is travelled back up until an entry with the same key is found. If the current entry is `auto` the value of the ancestor's entry is copied. Or if the current entry and ancestor entry is a dictionary, they are merged with the current entry overwriting any values in it's ancestors.
/// + Each entry that is a dictionary is then resolved from step 1.
