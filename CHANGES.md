# 0.3.0

CeTZ 0.3.0 requires Typst 0.11.0
The licence changed from Apache-2.0 to LGPLv3.

CeTZ' plotting and charting functionality has been moved to a separate 
package called `cetz-plot`.

## Canvas
- Fixed a bug with `#set place(float: true)` affecting the canvas.
- Transformation matrices are now rounded
- The default coordinate system changed to a right-hand side system.
  Use `scale(z: -1)` if you want to change back to a left-hand system.
- The `on-<axes>` functions lead to wrong anchors and got fixed. The offset
  argument is now behaving as tranlation instead of hard setting the coordinate!
- A new `scope(...)` element got added that behaves like a unnamed group but
  leaking child elements to the outside. This element can be used for scoping
  transformations, without having to scope children under a group name.
- The center anchor of `content()` with two coordinates got fixed when using
  negative cordinates.

## Draw
- Added `floating` function for drawing elements without affecting bounding boxes.

## Marks
- Added support for mark `anchor` style key, to adjust mark placement and
  allow for centered marks.

## Plot
- **BREAKING** The plot library has been moved out of cetz
- Added support for automatically adding axis breaks (sawtooth lines) by setting the `break`
  attribute of an axis to `true`.
- Added a new errorbar function: `add-errorbar`
- Added errorbar support to the `add-bar` function
- Improved the performance & memory consumption of the clipping algorithm
- **BREAKING** Legend anchors got renamed and do not use the legend prefix anymore

## Chart
- **BREAKING** The chart library has been moved out of cetz
- Added errorbar support for bar- and columncharts
- Piecharts now support a legend (see `legend.label` style)
- **BREAKING** Legend anchors got renamed and do not use the legend prefix anymore

## Anchors
- `copy-anchors` no longer requires copied anchors to have a default, allowing the copying of an element's anchors from a group as expected.

# 0.2.2

## Anchors
- Support for accessing anchors within groups.
- Support string shorthand for path and border anchors.

## 3D
- CeTZ gained some helper functions for drawing 3D figures in orthographic projection: `ortho`, `on-xy`, `on-xz` and `on-yz`.

## Plot
- New axes style key `tick.label.show` to force showing tick labels on mirrored axes.
- Axes tick format can now be set to `none` or content, without defaulting to floating point ticks.

## Fixes
- Fixed piechart styles when using `clockwise: true`.
- Fixed `decorations.flat-brace` vertical positioning
- Fixed drawing of mirrored plot axis ticks.
- Fixed plots with only annotions.
- Added matrix rounding to fix rounding errors when using lots of transforms

# 0.2.1

## Anchors
- Changing a group's "center" anchor now effects how border anchors are calculated.
- Allowed changing of the default anchor for groups.
- Re-added "a", "b", and "c" anchors for `circle-through`
- Open arcs are no longer modified for anchors, invalid border anchors will panic.
- Grids now actually support border anchors.

## Marks
- Marks can now be placed on a path after that path got transformed. See the new `transform-shape` style key.

## Misc
- The `hide` function now support an additional `bounds:` parameter to enable canvas bounds adjustment for hidden elements
- The default transformation matrix changed

## Charts
- Default piechart rotation changed from counter-clockwise to clockwise
- Default piechart start/stop angles changed so that the first item
  starts at 90° (ccw)

## Libs
### Plot

- New style keys for enabling/disabling the shared zero tick for "school-book" style plots
- New style keys for specifying the layer of different plot elements (`grid-layer`, `axis-layer`, `background-layer`)
- Fixed annotation bounds calculation
- Marks insides annotations are now unaffected by the plots canvas scaling by default (see marks new post-transform style key)

# 0.2.0
CeTZ 0.2.0 requires Typst 0.10.0

## Libs
### Draw
- **BREAKING** Default anchors are now using TikZ like compass names: north, south, east, west, north-west, north-east, south-west and south-east
- **BREAKING** Element anchors have changed! See the documentation for details.
- **BREAKING** Rotation direction changed to CCW
- **BREAKING** Removed the `shadow` function
- **BREAKING** Changed the behaviour of `mark`
- **BREAKING** Changed the behaviour of `translate` by changing the transformation order, changed arguments of `scale` and `translate`
- **BREAKING** LERP coordinates now use ratio instead of float for relative interpolation.
- **BREAKING** Removed `place-marks` and `place-anchors` functions, use the new mark `pos:` attribute and path anchors `(name: <element>, anchor: <number, ratio>)` instead.
- Content padding has been improved to be configurable per side
- Groups support same padding options as content
- Overhauled marks, see manual for the new mark symbols, placement- and styling options
- Fixed and improved intersection calculation
- Fixed and improved the styling algorithm
- Catmull-Rom curves, Hobby curves and arcs now can have marks

# 0.1.0
## Plot
- Added arguments `plot-style` and `mark-style` to the `plot(..)` base function
