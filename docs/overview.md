# Overview

CeTZ, ein Typst Zeichenpaket, is a drawing package for [Typst](https://typst.app/). Its API is similar to Processing but with relative coordinates and anchors from Ti*k*Z. You also won't have to worry about accidentally drawing over other content as the canvas will automatically resize. And remember: up is positive!

These docs are a work in progress! Please submit issues for parts that don't make sense or need improving :)

We are also still trying to find a logo for CeTZ so if you have any ideas please let us know through the Typst discord server.
