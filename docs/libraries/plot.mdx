The plot library allows the plotting of data.

## Types

The following types are commonly used by functions of this library

### <Type>domain</Type>

A tuple representing a mathematical function's domain as a closed interval. Example domains are `(0, 1)` for $[0,1]$ or `(-calc.pi, calc.pi)` for $[-\pi, \pi]$.

### <Type>axes</Type>

A tuple of axis names. Functions that take <Type>axes</Type> will use those axes as their `x` and `y` axis for plotting. To rotate a plot, you can simply swap its axes such as `("y", "x")`.
