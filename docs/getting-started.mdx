## Usage

This is the minimal starting point in a `.typ` file:

```typ
#import "@preview/cetz:0.3.1"
#cetz.canvas({
  import cetz.draw: *
  ...
})
```

Note that draw functions are imported inside the scope of the `canvas` block. This is recommended as some draw functions override Typst's functions such as `line`.

## Examples

From this point on only the code inside the `canvas` block will be shown in examples unless specified otherwise.

```typc example
circle((0, 0))
line((0, 0), (2, 1))
```
