# Custom Types

Many CeTZ functions expect data in certain formats which we will call types. Note that these are actually made up of Typst primitives.

## <Type>coordinate</Type>

A position on the canvas specified by any coordinate system. See [Coordinate Systems](coordinate-systems).

## <Type>number</Type>

Any of <Type>float</Type>, <Type>int</Type> or <Type>length</Type>.

## <Type>style</Type>

Represents options passed to draw functions that affect how elements are drawn. They are normally taken in the form of named arguments to the draw functions or sometimes can be a dictionary for a single argument.
