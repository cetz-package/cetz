You can style draw elements by passing the relevant named arguments to their draw functions. All elements that draw something have stroke and fill styling unless said otherwise.

<Parameter name="fill" types="color,none" default_value="none">
  How to fill the drawn element.
</Parameter>
<Parameter
  name="stroke"
  types="none,auto,length,color,dictionary,stroke"
  default_value="black"
>
  How to stroke the border or the path of the draw element. [See Typst's line
  documentation for more
  details.](https://typst.app/docs/reference/visualize/line/#parameters-stroke)
</Parameter>
<Parameter name="fill-rule" types="string" default_value="&quot;non-zero&quot;">
  How to fill self-intersecting paths. Can be "non-zero" or "even-odd".
  [See Typst's path documentation for more details.](https://typst.app/docs/reference/visualize/path/#parameters-fill-rule)
</Parameter>



```typc example
// Draws a red circle with a blue border
circle((0, 0), fill: red, stroke: blue)

// Draws a green line
line((0, 0), (1, 1), stroke: green)
```

Instead of having to specify the same styling for each time you want to draw an element, you can use the [`set-style`](/api/draw-functions/styling/set-style) function to change the style for all elements after it, like a Typst `set` rule. You can still pass styling to a draw function to override what has been set with `set-style`. You can also use the [`fill`](/api/draw-functions/styling/fill) and [`stroke`](/api/draw-functions/styling/stroke) functions as a shorthand to set the fill and stroke respectively.

```typc example
// Draws an empty square with a black border
rect((-1, -1), (1, 1))

// Sets the global style to have a fill of red and a stroke of blue
set-style(stroke: blue, fill: red)
circle((0,0))

// Draws a green line despite the global stroke being blue
line((), (1,1), stroke: green)
```

When using a dictionary for a style, it is important to note that they update each other instead of overriding the entire option like a non-dictionary value would. For example, if the stroke is set to `(paint: red, thickness: 5pt)` and you pass `(paint: blue)`, the stroke would become `(paint: blue, thickness: 5pt)`.

```typc example
// Sets the stroke to red with a thickness of 5pt
set-style(stroke: (paint: red, thickness: 5pt))

// Draws a line with the global stroke
line((0,0), (1,0))

// Draws a blue line with a thickness of 5pt because dictionaries update the style
line((0,0), (1,1), stroke: (paint: blue))

// Draws a yellow line with a thickness of 1pt because other values override the style
line((0,0), (0,1), stroke: yellow)
```

You can also specify styling for each type of element. Note that dictionary values will still update with its global value, the full hierarchy is `function > element type > global`. When the value of a style is <Type>auto</Type>, it will become exactly its parent style.

```typc example
set-style(
  // Global fill and stroke
  fill: green,
  stroke: (thickness: 5pt),
  // Stroke and fill for only rectangles
  rect: (stroke: (dash: "dashed"), fill: blue),
)
rect((0,0), (1,1))
circle((2.5, 0.5))
rect((4, 0), (5, 1), stroke: (thickness: 1pt))
```
